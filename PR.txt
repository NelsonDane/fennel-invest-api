Set explicit Fennel order route from env to avoid maintenance-only default


  - Problem: Fennel order placement fails with 400 because the SDK default route hits a maintenance-
    only endpoint.
  - Fix: Load FENNEL_ROUTE at order time, normalize/validate it, and pass it explicitly to place_order
    (defaulting to EXCHANGE_ATS_SDP).
  - Files touched: src/brokerages/fennel_api.py

  Testing:

  - Manual: place a dry run and a small order with FENNEL_ROUTE=EXCHANGE_ATS_SDP and confirm no 400
    error.
  - Optional: set FENNEL_ROUTE=QUIK and verify orders still succeed.

  Notes:

  - This keeps behavior compatible with the SDK while avoiding maintenance-only defaults.
  - If a bad FENNEL_ROUTE is set, the code warns and falls back safely.
